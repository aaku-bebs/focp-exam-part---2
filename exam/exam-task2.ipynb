    "### My Preferred Approach\n",
    "I work best when I can focus deeply and break problems into small steps. \n",
    "I prefer working in a quiet space with minimal distractions, as this helps me think logically and clearly.\n",

    "### Tools and Environment\n",
    "\n",
    "I enjoy using simple, well-designed tools that let me concentrate on the code itself rather than configuration issues.\n",
    "\n",
    "Key things that help me include:\n",
    "\n",
    " A comfortable desk and chair\n",
    " A quiet room or noise-cancelling headphones\n",
    " An IDE with syntax highlighting and error hints\n",
    "\n",
    "Overall, I find that a calm environment and clear goals allow me to write better code and learn more effectively.\n"
